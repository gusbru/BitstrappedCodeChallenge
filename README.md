# Node API Code Challenge

Purpose of this challenge is to build a simple NodeJS api,
hook into `https://api.ratesapi.io/api/latest` and return back
the results for a specific country code

## Steps

1. Create Node.js API
2. Connect to RatesApi.io
3. Create 2 routes.
   a. One route returns all the currencies (`/all`);
   b. the other route takes in a currency as a route parameter and returns the exchange rate for that currency
4. Setup docker container
5. Deploy Node.js code on a server, any server.
6. Bonus: add another route that accepts the base as a query parameter. I.e api.com/CAD?base=USD

## Completion:

Once complete ensure it is deployed on a server and public, then checked in the code to a source code repository such as github.
